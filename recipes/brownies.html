   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fudgy brownies will be gobbled up almost as quickly as it takes to make them! <br>
    If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. 
    <br> These vegan brownies are great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of hot coffee</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            <br>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour in coffee, vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread batter evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny and center feels just set when gently pressed, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares. Enjoy!</li>
